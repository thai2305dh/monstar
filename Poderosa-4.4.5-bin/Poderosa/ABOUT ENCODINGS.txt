To use UTF-8, there are two options, "UTF-8 (CJK)" and "UTF-8 (Latin)".

The difference between these options is which font and character width
are used to display some kind of characters.

 UTF-8 (CJK)
    Characters contained in CJK character sets are displayed as the
    wide-width characters using CJK font.

    Some symbols, box-drawing characters or european characters may be
    displayed as the wide-width characters.

 UTF-8 (Latin)
    Characters other than east asian characters like Kanji are displayed
    as the narrow-width characters using main font.

    Symbols, box-drawing characters or european characters will be
    displayed as the narrow-width characters.


For example, "DEGREE SIGN" (U+00B0) will be displayed as a wide-width
character in "UTF-8 (CJK)" mode.

Because some CJK character sets define their "DEGREE SIGN" character
as a wide-width character like below.

  Shift JIS   818B
  EUC JP      A1EB
  GB2312      A1E3
  Big5        A258
  EUC KR      A1C6

In general, these characters are mapped to U+00B0.
